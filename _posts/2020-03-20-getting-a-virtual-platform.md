Due to the current conditions around the world, getting together at a bar or hackerspace isn't the right thing, so to still be able to share our projects and get feedback from others, we now hhave a Discord server.

In addition to local coordination and communication, this will also open up to a broader group of people, that doesn't live close to one of the current groups and haven't yet started their own Hardware Happy Hour.

Please [join the fun at the Hardware Happy Hour Discord server](https://discordapp.com/invite/ckFFN8B)
